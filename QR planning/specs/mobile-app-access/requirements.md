# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Mobile App Access feature allows users to share their active login sessions (like Netflix, social media, etc.) with others without sharing passwords. Users can generate a QR code or link from their logged-in desktop browser that allows someone else to access the same account on their mobile device or another browser, using the existing session cookies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to generate a QR code from my current session, so that I can share access to my account without giving my password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is logged into a website THEN the system SHALL capture the current session cookies and authentication data
2. WHEN the user clicks "Share Session" THEN the system SHALL generate a QR code containing a secure link
3. WHEN the QR code is created THEN the system SHALL show the website name (e.g., "Netflix Session")
4. WHEN the link is generated THEN the system SHALL set a 30-minute expiration for security
5. IF the user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL show a message "Please log in first"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As someone receiving a shared session, I want to scan the QR code or click the link, so that I can access the account without needing the password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the QR code is scanned THEN the system SHALL show a link with the website name (e.g., "Access Netflix Account")
2. WHEN the link is clicked THEN the system SHALL apply the session cookies to the browser
3. WHEN cookies are applied THEN the system SHALL redirect to the website's main page
4. WHEN the redirect happens THEN the user SHALL be automatically logged in
5. IF the link is expired THEN the system SHALL show "Session expired, ask for a new link"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user sharing my session, I want the shared access to be temporary and secure, so that my account remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN session data is shared THEN the system SHALL encrypt all cookies and tokens
2. WHEN 60 minutes pass THEN the system SHALL automatically delete the shared session data
3. WHEN the link is used once THEN the system SHALL optionally delete it (configurable)
4. WHEN sharing Netflix or similar services THEN the system SHALL work with streaming platforms
5. IF someone uses the shared session THEN the original user SHALL remain logged in on their device
